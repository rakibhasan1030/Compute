The `Compute` library is a lightweight and versatile Kotlin utility for performing common mathematical operations. It provides a simple and intuitive interface through the `Calculator` class, allowing developers to easily handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numeric values.

## üîë Key Features:
 - Addition: Perform addition of two numbers with ease.
 - Subtraction: Calculate the difference between two numbers effortlessly.
 - Multiplication: Multiply numeric values effortlessly.
 - Division: Safely handle division with built-in checks for dividing by zero.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Compute is installed by adding the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

#### Gradle Groovy DSL
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.rakibhasan1030:Compute:1.0.0'
}
```

#### Gradle Kotlin DSL
```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.rakibhasan1030:Compute:1.0.0")
}
```

#### Apache Maven
Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
```kotlin
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
</repositories>
```
#### Add the dependency
```kotlin
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.rakibhasan1030</groupId>
        <artifactId>Compute</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage 
To get started with Compute, just invoke the Calculator class and tailor its functionality to suit your requirements.<br>Example:
```kotlin
import rakib.hasan.compute.Calculator

fun main() {
    // Example usage of the Calculator class
    try {
        // Add two numbers
        val sum = Calculator.add(5.0, 3.0)
        println("Sum: $sum")

        // Subtract two numbers
        val difference = Calculator.subtract(8.0, 4.0)
        println("Difference: $difference")

        // Multiply two numbers
        val product = Calculator.multiply(2.0, 6.0)
        println("Product: $product")

        // Divide two numbers
        val quotient = Calculator.divide(10.0, 2.0)
        println("Quotient: $quotient")
    } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
        println("Error: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```
